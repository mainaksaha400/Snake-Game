# Snake-Game
This repository contains the complete code base of a classic game: 'Snake game', developed completely with HTML5, CSS and JavaScript.

The rules/functionality of the game is as follows:

A classic game where the user can control the movement of the snake within the grid. The snake has to consume the food placed at random locations within the grid to gain score. Every time the snake consumes food, the length of the snake increases by 1, the score increases by 1, and new food is placed at another random location within the grid. If the snake clashes with any of the four boundaries of the grid or if the snake bites itself, the game ends.

The user gets the option to choose from 2 levels of difficulty: 'Novice' and 'Mastermind'. The speed of the snake in the 'Mastermind' level is twice the speed of the snake in the 'Novice' level.
